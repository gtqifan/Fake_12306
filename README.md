# Fake 12306

12306.cn is an offical and only website for searching and buying train tickets in mainland China. This project mainly uses JavaScript and builds up a user-interactive ticket searching service through API from AliCloud. Several key terms that I learned recently such as API authentications, regex pattern comparatsion, filtering, and asynchronous functions are used in this project.
